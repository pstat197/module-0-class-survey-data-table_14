## Executive summary

We analyzed anonymized intake-survey responses from two sections to answer one question: **Is self-reported statistics proficiency associated with the number of PSTAT courses completed?** Using descriptive plots and a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test (implemented in `Question_1.Rmd`), we find evidence of a statistically significant association: respondents reporting higher statistics proficiency have, on average, completed more PSTAT courses. Because the responses are a **sample** of offered-seat students, we emphasize clear visuals and center-focused summaries appropriate for modest (n).

## Data description

-   **How obtained.** Google Forms intake survey; exported and shared as two section files with identifiers removed plus a metadata file.\
-   **Sample.** Respondents from two course sections; treated as a **sample** from all offered-seat students (not necessarily a census).\
-   **Measurements.** Demographics; self-assessed **proficiency** and **comfort** (Likert 1–5); indicators for prior coursework; and project preferences. For Q1, we use `stat.prof` (statistics proficiency; ordered beginner → intermediate → advanced) and `pstat_courses_total` (sum of PSTAT course indicators per student).

## Question of interest

1.  **Q1.** Does self-reported statistics proficiency relate to the number of PSTAT courses completed?

## Findings (Q1)

**Question.** Is self-reported statistics proficiency associated with the number of PSTAT courses completed?

**What we did.** We summarized the distribution of proficiency levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and compared total PSTAT coursework across groups using descriptive plots (composition chart, boxplot, and mean ± SD bar chart with a trend view). We then ran a one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD post-hoc comparisons using the code in `results/Question_1.Rmd`.

### Proficiency composition
![Distribution of Students by Statistics Proficiency Level](Untitled/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

Most respondents did not record a proficiency level (NA is the largest slice). Among those who did, Advanced is more common than Intermediate, and Beginner is the smallest group. This matters for two reasons: (1) our comparisons are essentially between a larger Advanced group and smaller Intermediate/Beginner groups, and (2) inferential tests should exclude the NA category since it is missing-by-design.

### PSTAT courses by proficiency (boxplot)

The center and spread of completed PSTAT courses shift upward from Beginner -> Intermediate -> Advanced. Beginners cluster at the low end; Intermediate has a higher median with modest spread; Advanced shows both a higher median and a longer right tail (some students have many courses). The NA group appears at zero because proficiency was not reported; we do not use NA in tests. Overlapping IQRs are limited, which is consistent with a real difference in central tendency.

### Average PSTAT courses (mean ± SD)

Group means increase with proficiency: Beginners average the fewest PSTAT courses, Intermediate is higher, and Advanced is highest. Error bars ($\pm$1 SD) overlap somewhat between Intermediate and Advanced, suggesting those two groups are similar on average. This aligns with the Tukey HSD results: both Intermediate and Advanced differ from Beginners, while Intermediate and Advanced are not statistically different from each other.

### Average PSTAT courses (trend)

The trend line provides a compact view of the monotone relationship: more completed PSTAT courses are associated with higher self–reported proficiency. The drop to zero at NA reflects missing proficiency rather than a true value and should not be interpreted substantively. Overall, the trend corroborates the boxplot and mean $\pm$ SD views.

### Inferential check (supports the visuals)

- **One-way ANOVA:** p = 0.008 (alpha = 0.05) -> mean PSTAT courses differ across proficiency groups.
- **Tukey’s HSD pairwise comparisons:**
  - Advanced vs Beginner: p = 0.0062 (significant)
  - Intermediate vs Beginner: p = 0.033 (significant)
  - Intermediate vs Advanced: p = 0.59 (not significant)

**Conclusion from tests:** The main differences are between **Beginners** and the other two groups; **Intermediate** and **Advanced** are not statistically different in this sample.

### Important decisions (for reproducibility)

- Constructed `pstat_courses_total` by summing the binary PSTAT course indicators per student.  
- Treated `stat.prof` as an **ordered** factor with levels `beg < int < adv`.  
- **NA** in `stat.prof` are shown in composition plots but excluded from ANOVA/Tukey.  
- Emphasized **medians/IQRs** (boxplot) alongside means ± SD to avoid over-interpreting tails for modest sample sizes.

### Interpretation and scope

Within this sample of students offered a seat, **greater PSTAT coursework is associated with higher self-reported statistics proficiency**, especially when comparing **Beginners** to **Intermediate/Advanced**. Because this is a respondent sample with some item nonresponse, we treat results as **descriptive evidence** rather than a population claim.

**Possible extensions.** Report group counts and medians in the text; check robustness with a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test; examine whether particular PSTAT sequences (e.g., 120/122/126) align most with higher self-ratings.
